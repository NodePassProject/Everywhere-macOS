# Everywhere

**One app. Three networking engines. Your rules.**

Everywhere is a powerful proxy and tunneling app for macOS that puts you in
charge of how your device talks to the internet. Bring your own
configuration, pick the engine you trust, and flip a switch. That's it.

## Why Everywhere?

Most networking apps lock you into a single backend and a single way of
doing things. Everywhere doesn't. It bundles three of the most popular
open-source proxy cores in one place, gives them a clean home, and lets
you move between them whenever you like.

## Features

### Cores

- **Xray-core** `v26.3.27` — battle-tested VLESS / VMess / Trojan /
  Shadowsocks with the full XTLS / Reality / XHTTP transport matrix
- **sing-box** `v1.13.11` — modern modular core with a strong rule
  engine, built with the full `with_*` tag matrix (QUIC, gVisor, uTLS,
  WireGuard, Tailscale, ACME, gRPC, clash API, v2ray stats…)
- **mihomo** `v1.19.24` — Clash-flavored ergonomics with rich proxy
  groups, fake-IP, and rule providers
- **Live core switching** — change engines from the Home tab whenever
  the tunnel is stopped; configurations don't get tangled across cores
- **Native TUN inbound per core** — each engine consumes the iOS `utun`
  file descriptor directly. No userspace `tun→socks` bridge, no extra
  hop, no extra latency

### App

- **Built-in code editor** — Tree-sitter syntax highlighting for JSON
  and YAML, line numbers, 80-column page guide, no autocorrect
  "helping" you turn `"server"` into `"sever"`
- **Bring configs from anywhere** — type one in, import a file, or paste
  a URL and let the app fetch it
- **Per-core configuration lists** — your Xray setups don't get mixed
  up with your mihomo ones
- **yacd dashboard** — bundled Clash dashboard for live traffic, proxy
  groups, and rule inspection (works with sing-box and mihomo)
- **Resource management** — drop `geoip.dat`, `geosite.dat`, `ASN.mmdb`,
  cache files, or PEMs into per-core resource folders; each engine sees
  them in the right place automatically

### Architecture

- **Native Network Extension** — `NEPacketTunnelProvider` owns the
  `utun` device; the extension and the app share configurations through
  an App Group container
- **gomobile-built framework** — Xray, sing-box, and mihomo compile into
  a single `EverywhereCore.xcframework` via `gomobile bind`, stripped
  with `-ldflags="-s -w"` so archive validation never demands a dSYM
- **Tree-sitter editor** — [Runestone](https://github.com/simonbs/Runestone)
  with the JSON and YAML grammars compiled in
- **Bundled web dashboard** — yacd is served from the app bundle via a
  custom `yacd://` URL scheme.

## Getting Started

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NodePassProject/Everywhere-macOS.git
cd Everywhere
./build.sh
open Everywhere.xcodeproj
```

`build.sh` fetches the upstream sources at their pinned tags, builds
the Go core into a framework with the right `with_*` tag matrix, and
wires it into the Xcode project. Then plug in your signing identity and
run on a device or the simulator.

To run an `xcodebuild` simulator smoke test as the final step:

```bash
./build.sh --build-app
```

## Patches & Upstream Tracking

Every change made on top of upstream sources, every build-tag decision,
and every wiring quirk per core is documented in
[`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md). When bumping an upstream tag, walk that
file. Right now all three upstreams build unmodified at the pinned
tags — the only patches are `go.mod` overrides and `gomobile`
mechanics.
